# Video Analysis Tool with OpenAI GPT-4 Vision

This tool analyzes video content using OpenAI's GPT-4 Vision API. It can process both video files and live camera feeds.

## Features

- üìπ Analyze video files with customizable frame sampling
- üì∑ Capture and analyze live camera feed
- ü§ñ Use GPT-4 Vision to describe video content
- üéØ Custom prompts for specific analysis needs
- üé¨ **NEW**: AI Film Director with voice feedback using ElevenLabs

## Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
# venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
```

Replace with your actual API keys:
- Get OpenAI API key from: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
- Get ElevenLabs API key from: https://elevenlabs.io/

### 4. Validate API Keys (Optional but Recommended)

Test your API keys before running the main applications:

```bash
python test_api_keys.py
```

This will verify that both your OpenAI and ElevenLabs API keys are valid and working.
